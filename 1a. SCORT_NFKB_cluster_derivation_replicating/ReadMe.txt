This folder contains the results for analysis conducted on the SCORT dataset using the clusters that Adam derived with kemans analysis.

I initially try to replicate the clusters he has and get close but not perfect despite similar/identical method - so not sure why not working.

Then proceed to do differential gene analysis and produce volcano plots and these show no differentially expressed genes - slightly dissapointing.

Therefore I want to now do broader kmeans to obtain intereseting clusters and better plots (on the whole dataset) and maybe come back to these clusters to assess predictive capacity.
