This folder contains the results for analysis conducted on the gse109057 dataset using kmeans clustering.

Then proceed to do differential gene analysis and produce volcano plots and these show not great results.

Therefore I want to now do broader kmeans to obtain intereseting clusters and better plots (on the whole dataset) and maybe come back to these clusters to assess predictive capacity.
