This folder compiles the gene lists for the SCORT data by looking at those identified as differentially expressed in both
the kmeans and pvclust versions of our analysis. This is done using a scorre system such that the best genes accross the
sets are taken - could maybe reconduct some of the analysis to obtain genelists of 50/100 for more complete search.

We then obtain a very small list by also cross referencing with the nfkb derived cluster differential genes.

When compared with geo the results aren't great - motivating the analysis in 5.
