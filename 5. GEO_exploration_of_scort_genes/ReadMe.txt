This folder attempts to predict clusterings for the geo data samples using the kmeans model from the scort data

This yields reasonable results with some crossover with the geo kmeans and pvclust result but could be better. 

But we do get reasonable gene lists for botht he geo sets

Need to verify similarity between gene lists from scort full and slight reduction (to only have the shared features).

The volcano plots show there are many significant genes - perhaps expand gene lists such to increase those we choose
 as so many differentially expressed so would be good to look at more of these.
